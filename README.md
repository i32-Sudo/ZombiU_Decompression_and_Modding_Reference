## MESSAGE FROM ME:
So going more on the date of 1.9.2024, I've done more testing and have released a hook for the function *lzopro_lzo1x_decompress* which allows dumping of decompressed data, I will eventually follow this up but for now, It's just a concept idea. I will also begin reversing the vTables for Rabbids Framework and Interfaces.
